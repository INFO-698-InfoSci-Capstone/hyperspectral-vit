# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

### Date: February 7, 2025

Week 3–4 (Jan 22–Feb 7)

### Number of hours:
	•	Jayant: 35 hours
	•	Hitarth: 35 hours

### Rose:
We laid a solid foundation by studying hyperspectral and vision systems research and trying to replicate leading models. That deep dive was crucial in finding gaps and framing our approach.

### Bud:
We have began hands-on model development and transition from theory to experiments.

### Thorn:
Coordination to align on reproducible baseline took effort.

### Additional thought
Along with Dr. Lee, we have organized a weekly meeting on every wednesday 12.30PM - 1.30PM to share our progress as well as to get mentor's input on the approach and hurdles.

Week 5–6 (Feb 8–Feb 21)

### Number of hours:
	•	Jayant: 33 hours
	•	Hitarth: 32 hours

### Rose:
We achieved a functional prototype and started seeing real progress with our architecture. It’s motivating to see it actually run and produce results.

### Bud:
Implemented the architectural improvements that we discussed with Dr. Lee. Initial results are encouraging.

### Thorn:
We had issues with model convergence at certain settings.

Week 7–8 (Feb 22–Mar 7)

### Number of hours:
	•	Jayant: 35 hours
	•	Hitarth: 35 hours

### Rose:
We finalized our model and submitted our ICCV paper! Our mentor’s guidance throughout the writing process helped us polish and submit a strong manuscript.

### Bud:
We’re eager to explore further optimization and conduct experiments to solidify our claims.

### Thorn:
Tight paper deadlines while managing experiments was stressful. Time management was tested heavily during this phase.


### Additional Thoughts 
For the final revision, Dr. Lee set up the online session for 4 hours, where we made improvised our paper - architecture diagram and overall representation of the paper. Greatful to Dr. Lee for his continuous guidance.
